# ChatGPT 2

ChatGPT is blocked on our school WiFi, so I made a website acting as a proxy to OpenAI. It declines requests appearing to have plagiaristic intent, and instead teaches the user about the requested topic. It also has a pretty interface.

Only accessible via a G-Suite email provided by our school district.
